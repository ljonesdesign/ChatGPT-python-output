The Chat GPT prompt for for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game was: **code a game of rock paper and scissors in python with line by line code explanations**

the output was this:

>Sure, here's a Python implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game with detailed line-by-line explanations:

Then the code block (see the `rock-paper-scissors.py` file).

The the following text:

>I've added comments for each section of the code to explain what it does. This should help you understand how the Rock, Paper, Scissors game is implemented in Python.

In another ChatGPT prompt I asked for a tutorial: 

> Certainly! Here's a simple Python implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game along with a step-by-step tutorial. This game will allow the user to play against the computer.

Then the code block.

Then the following text:

Now, let's go through the code step by step:

    1. We start by importing the `random` module, which we'll use to generate the computer's choice.

    2. We define a function `get_user_choice()` to get the user's input for Rock, Paper, or Scissors. We use a while loop to keep prompting the user until they enter a valid choice.

    3. The `get_computer_choice()` function generates a random choice for the computer.

    4. The `determine_winner()` function takes the user's and computer's choices as input and determines the winner based on the game rules. It also prints the result of the round.

    5. The `play_game()` function is the main function for playing the game. It displays a welcome message and repeatedly asks the user for their choice, computes the computer's choice, and determines the winner. It also asks if the user wants to play again.

    6. Finally, in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, we call the `play_game()` function to start the game when the script is run.

To play the game, run the script in your Python environment, and follow the on-screen prompts. Have fun playing Rock, Paper, Scissors!
