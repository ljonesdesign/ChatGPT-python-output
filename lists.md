# Lists
In Python, a list is a versatile and commonly used data structure that allows you to store and 
manipulate a collection of elements. Lists are ordered, mutable (modifiable), and can contain 
elements of different data types. Lists are defined using square brackets `[ ]` and elements within the 
list are separated by commas.

Here's an overview of how lists work in Python:

## 1. Creating Lists:

You can create a list by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements within square brackets. For example:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
empty_list = []
mixed_list = [1, "Hello", 3.14, True]
```
