Maybe you don't understand why the code on line 59 was used. What will we get if we ask ChatGPT, "What does this mean in python: __name__"

This actually took a bit longer for ChatGPT to process than the Rock, Paper, Scissors code:

>In Python, __name__ is a built-in variable that is used to determine whether a Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module into another script. It is a common idiom used in Python to structure code that can be both a standalone program and a module that can be reused in other programs.

Here's how it works:

1. When a Python script is executed, the __name__ variable is set to "__main__" if it is the main program being run.

2. When a Python script is imported as a module into another script, the __name__ variable is set to the name of the script/module.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```
# my_module.py

def say_hello():
    print("Hello from my_module!")

# When this script is run as the main program, __name__ is set to "__main__"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("This script is being run as the main program.")
else:
    print("This script is being imported as a module.")
```

Now, let's consider another script that imports the my_module:

```
# main_program.py
import my_module

my_module.say_hello()

# When this script is run, __name__ for my_module is set to "my_module"
# So, the output will be:
# This script is being imported as a module.
# Hello from my_module!

```

In this example, when my_module.py is imported into main_program.py, the __name__ variable in my_module.py is
not set to "__main__". Instead, it is set to "my_module" because it is being imported. 
This allows you to create reusable modules without running the code in those modules when 
they are imported into other scripts.

The use of if __name__ == "__main__": is a common practice to ensure that certain code blocks
in a script are executed only when the script is run as the main program and not when it's imported as a module. 
This way, you can have code that is both reusable as a module and executable as a standalone program.
