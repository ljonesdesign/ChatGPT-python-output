# ChatGPT-python-output

This Repository contains raw output from ChatGPT prompts. 

The first prompt was for ChatGPT to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 

After scanning over the code I noticed that there was an example of a list. So then I asked ChatGPT to explain how lists work in Python. 

Then I noticed the `__name__` variable on line 59 and asked ChatGPT what `__name__` meant in Python.
