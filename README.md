# ChatGPT-python-output

This Repository documents some ChatGPT experimentation to determine if ChatGPT is a worthwhile tool for learning how to code using the Python Language.

The target learner is someone that has some rudimentary understanding of Python. Maybe they have completed one or two assignments and understand outputting basic strings, varibles, simple math and some if-elif-else practice, but has not yet worked with loops or functions. 

ChatGPT was asked to create a rock, paper, scissors game to serve as a goal for the next step in the learning process. Some of the concepts that are new at this stage are functions, import random, lists, and while loops. Loops and functions will be introduced in this next sessions, so it seems it may be beneficial to introduce this program at this stage and ask some more questions of ChatGPT.

contains raw output from ChatGPT prompts. 

The first prompt was for ChatGPT to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 

After scanning over the code I noticed that there was an example of a list. So then I asked ChatGPT to explain how lists work in Python. 

Then I noticed the `__name__` variable on line 59 and asked ChatGPT what `__name__` meant in Python.

What else can we do to learn more about how this program works by using ChatGPT prompts?
